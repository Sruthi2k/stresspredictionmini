        "Because of its efficient and straightforward nature, doesn't require high computation power, easy to implement, easily interpretable, used widely by data analyst and scientist. Also, it doesn't require scaling of features. Logistic regression provides a probability score for observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages**\n",
        "Logistic regression is not able to handle a large number of categorical features/variables. It is vulnerable to overfitting. Also, can't solve the non-linear problem with the logistic regression that is why it requires a transformation of non-linear features. Logistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other."
